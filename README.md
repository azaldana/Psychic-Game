This is the Psychic Game. The computer randomly chooses a letter between A-Z and it is up to the user to guess correctly before your guesses run out. 

To begin, start guessing a letter from the alphabet. You will have 9 guesses at the start of the game to guess correctly. If the user is able to guess correctly within those 9 guesses then they have won and the game is reset with the computer generating another random letter. 

If the user does not guess correctly within the alloted 9 guesses, then the user has lost and the game is again reset. 

This game demonstrates the logic of having the computer randomly select a letter after every restart and allowing the user to repeatedly play the game without having to refresh the page.
